**Epic Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Zainab Rizvi**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I had trouble with implementing the function that handles guesses (guess()), specifically with how to check that the guess is correct or incorrect.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   Since this was my first time doing web development, this submission has made me excited and curious to learn more about the subject. Specifically, something I definitely want to explore is how  websites are kept secure, and what kind of attacks a website that is not secure is vulnerable to. For example, how would a website that needs to take in sensitive information from a user, such as a password or bank details, ensure the privacy of a userâ€™s information? Would encryption be a good enough to keep the website secure, or are there other methods implemented as well? 

   I would also love to learn about the the javascript language, and why it is preferred for web development over other languages. What specific features make it more compatible for websites, and is it only applicable for use on the client-side, or can it also be used for the server-side programming?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   One thing I would love to delve deeper into is how much I can alter the design of my web page through the rules in CSS. Many websites I have visited have cool animations for elements that appear as you scroll down the page, and I would love to implement something similar with the game buttons on my webpage, i.e. only have them fade in once the start button is pressed. In addition, I would like to spend more time to implement the bonus features I did not have a chance to finish, especially having the buttons play different audio than the generated tones. Currently, I have chosen the frequencies for each tone to be that of a musical note (a-f since I have 6 buttons). To better this, I thought to replace the tones of each button with piano notes, and this way the secret sequence can be a melody to a song. This could also be extended to being a way to helping the player learn the song.
